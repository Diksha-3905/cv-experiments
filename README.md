# cv-experiments
A collection of computer vision projects built using OpenCV, YOLOv8, TensorFlow, and Python. This repository features hands-on implementations of object detection, image segmentation, face recognition, and real-time video analysis. Designed as a personal lab to explore modern visual AI techniques and deepen my understanding of computer vision.
